- Play around with cut off for minimum word frequency (make flag)
- Test on large gene clusters
- Move documetation from web page to readme
- Different input modes (more from rob later)
- Add more gene info (.obo files, Rob to find sources)
- Combine like words (low priority, unless I have a breakthrough idea on doing this)
- Figure out way to store and present web links (Done, 12/1/14)
- Add options for "machine readable" out put and displaying web links (done 11/30/14)
