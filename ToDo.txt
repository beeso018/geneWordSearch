To-Do List of features/capabilities:
(In categorical, but not priority order)

Database Things
- Look at sqlite for new data structure (along with code generalization for other species)
- Custom Database (give columns and make db from there)
- Be able to change the universe of genes (Subset of all genes)

Word Analysis Things
- Give context for word (Surrounding sentance, may reserve for gui version)
- Make word splitting smarter (piece by piece)
- Combine like words (low priority, unless I have a breakthrough idea on doing this)

Other Things
- GUI (look at flask)
- Multiple network deep search

Recently Done
- Add to PyPI and make sure install works
- Create a gene neighborhood function using the networks (in test dir) (Print genes, then print results for geneWordSearch) (Done, 1/11/15)
- Different input modes (Added some (file, directory, and network) if there are more, let me know)
- Add more gene info (Don't seen to have any more for maize)
- Add maize gene networks for input into main function
