To-Do List of features/capabilities:

- Add to PyPI and make sure install works
- Create a gene neighborhood function using the networks (in test dir) (Print genes, then print results for geneWordSearch) (Done, 1/11/15)
- Give context for word (Surrounding sentance, may reserve for gui version)
- GUI (look at flask)
- Make word splitting smarter (piece by piece)
- Different input modes (more from rob later)
- Add more gene info (.obo files, Rob to find sources)
- Combine like words (low priority, unless I have a breakthrough idea on doing this)
- Custom Database (give columns and make db from there)
- Look at sqlite for data structure (included and custom built) (Along with Arabadopsis move)
- Network analysis further (How many networks, etc.)
- Be able to change the universe of genes (Subset of all genes)
