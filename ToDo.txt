To-Do List of features/capabilities:

- Make setup.py and look at disttools
- Create a gene neighborhood function using the networks (in test dir) (Print genes, then print results for network)
- Give context for word (Surrounding sentance, may reserve for gui version)
- GUI (look at flask)
- Make word splitting smarter (piece by piece)
- Different input modes (more from rob later)
- Add more gene info (.obo files, Rob to find sources)
- Combine like words (low priority, unless I have a breakthrough idea on doing this)
